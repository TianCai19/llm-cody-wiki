# Prompting

Guides, patterns, and references for designing effective prompts.

## Common Patterns
- Zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, self-consistency
- Structured output with JSON and schemas
- Role, instruction, examples, constraints

## Considerations
- Determinism vs creativity (temperature, top-p)
- Injecting knowledge via RAG vs prompt stuffing
- Evaluation with task-specific metrics
